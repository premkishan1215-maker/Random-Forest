# **App Name**: Forest Insights

## Core Features:

- Audience Selection: Allows users to select from different audience types (Farmer, Doctor, Student), tailoring the dataset, terminology, and visuals accordingly.
- Dataset Story Section: Presents a unique dataset story and visual scene for each audience, including a dataset overview table, pie chart, histogram, scatter plot, and correlation heatmap.
- Synthetic Data Generator: Generates new, audience-specific synthetic data with added noise to simulate real-world scenarios, displayed with animated data points, box plots, violin plots, and histogram comparisons.
- Step-by-Step Algorithm Visualization: Provides an interactive, visual explanation of the Random Forest algorithm through six stages, including data understanding, sampling, tree building, forest formation, voting, and model evaluation, utilizing animations, charts, and illustrated scenes.
- Interactive Tree-Level Exploration: Allows users to click on individual trees in the Random Forest visualization to zoom in and view detailed information such as the tree's decision structure, feature importance, split thresholds, and predictions.
- Parameter Control Playground: Enables users to adjust various parameters of the Random Forest algorithm using interactive sliders and dropdowns, with clear explanations tailored to each audience type.
- Intuitive Explanations: Presents each graph with a one-line metaphor and hover tooltips to provide clear and simple explanations of complex concepts, making the algorithm more accessible.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C), evoking growth and knowledge. 
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral backdrop for the visualizations. 
- Accent color: Sky blue (#3F51B5), used for interactive elements and highlights, providing a sense of clarity and precision.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif for a personalized style. Body font: 'Alegreya' serif for readability. 
- Utilize audience-specific icons and scenes: Farm for Farmers, Hospital for Doctors, Classroom for Students. Each section will transition smoothly with Framer Motion.
- Implement an intuitive dashboard layout with clear sections for audience selection, data story, algorithm visualization, parameter control, and learning summary. Each section will have dedicated space and logical flow.
- Use SVG and Lottie animations to bring the data and algorithm to life, making the learning experience more engaging and memorable. Transitions should be smooth, using Framer Motion to maintain user experience.
